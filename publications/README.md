<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>

The paper presents a web application for smart crop production data exchange, integrating the Antelope blockchain and the Interplanetary File System (IPFS). Using smart contracts, the platform enables secure data storage, file sharing, and token transfers, ensuring transaction transparency and security. Designed with open-source solutions, it allows authentication via blockchain accounts or standard wallets like Anchor. Future development focuses on performance, scalability, and security testing to evolve the platform into a fully decentralized application (dApp).

### üîó Web Application for Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Implementation and Testing  
*Electronics (MDPI), 2024*  
[DOI: 10.3390/electronics13071361](https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics13071361)

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>

The paper explores the implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology with open-source large language models (LLMs). A dedicated web-based application, PaSSER, was developed, integrating Mistral:7b, Llama2:7b, and Orca2:7b models. The study evaluates LLM performance using METEOR, ROUGE, BLEU, perplexity, cosine similarity, Pearson correlation, and F1 score, particularly within the smart agriculture domain. Additionally, it examines hardware considerations, revealing that GPUs are essential for fast text generation. The paper also discusses blockchain integration for storing and managing assessment results, with future development focused on fine-tuning LLMs and further blockchain integration.

### üîó Similarity Thresholds in Retrieval-Augmented Generation  
*IEEE IS 2024*  
[DOI: 10.1109/IS61756.2024.10705214](https://doi.org/10.1109/IS61756.2024.10705214)

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>

The study evaluates the performance of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs)‚ÄîMistral:7b, Llama2:7b, and Orca2:7b‚Äîin the context of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The research identifies optimal similarity score thresholds for LLMs using NLP metrics and a custom-developed dataset in agriculture. Tests were conducted using the PaSSER web-based application, an extension of the Smart Crop Production Data Exchange (SCPDx) platform. The findings show that different LLMs perform best at varying similarity thresholds, with Mistral and Llama excelling at 0.55, and Orca achieving peak performance at 0.65. Future development aims to integrate larger LLMs (40B+), explore fine-tuning strategies, and further enhance PaSSER‚Äôs infrastructure.

<summary><strong>Abstract (preview)</strong></summary>

This paper reviews the evolution of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, focusing on recent advancements that address the limitations of traditional language models. It explores modular RAG architectures, data-centric training strategies, and hybrid retrieval techniques that combine structured and unstructured knowledge. The study examines enhancements in factual grounding, domain specialization, and multimodal reasoning, while identifying key challenges such as retrieval precision, evidence alignment, and self-refinement. It also outlines emerging evaluation frameworks, including RAGAS, RGB, and PaSSER. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research, emphasizing the need for unified, trustworthy, and adaptable RAG systems.
